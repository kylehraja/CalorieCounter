# Calorie Counter
A Calorie Counter project that calculates how many calories the user has consumed, comparing it to their calorie budget/goal. 

In this project, I validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update your interface to display the results.
Basic regular expressions, template literals, the addEventListener() method, and more are used.
